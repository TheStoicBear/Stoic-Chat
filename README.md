This is still being developed, fixed, and optimized, yet I do need some input from the community / people to test, therefore I would greatly appreciate any feedback :slight_smile: 

### ND-Framework is required for some resource to work right as of now.

## Configuration Overview

The configuration file, named `config.lua`, includes various customizable sections:

- General settings such as language, text color, font, and display duration.
- Customization for specific chat commands like `/darkweb`, `/rto`, `/911`, and `/panic`.
- Configuration for chat tags, staff chat, and toggling specific commands.
- Custom URLs for commands and default tags for players without permissions.
- In-game chat settings and Discord webhook settings.
